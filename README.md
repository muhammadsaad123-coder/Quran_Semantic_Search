 Quran Semantic Search Engine
The Quran Semantic Search Engine is a web-based application designed to make exploring the Quran easier and more meaningful. This project allows users to search Quranic text using three approaches: single-word search, word-pair search, and contextual semantic search. Built with modern web technologies and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system delivers accurate and contextually relevant results.

Features
1. Search Capabilities:  
   - Single-Word Search: Highlights the specific word in relevant verses.  
   - Word-Pair Search: Highlights pairs of words (bigram) in the Quran.  
   - Semantic Search: Displays contextually similar verses using Word2Vec and WordNet for query expansion.  

2. Audio Playback:  
   - Reads Quranic translations aloud using the SpeechSynthesis API.  
   - Highlights words dynamically during playback for better understanding.  

3. User Management:  
   - Signup, login, or guest access options.  
   - Stores user data in MongoDB for authentication.  

4. Responsive Frontend:  
   - Built with React.js, providing a smooth user experience.  

5. Backend Integration:  
   - Node.js and Express.js for handling API requests.  
   - Python scripts for NLP tasks like unigram, bigram, and semantic searches.  

6. Database:  
   - MongoDB for user authentication.  
   - Quran dataset stored in an Excel file for processing.  

 Technologies Used
 
- Frontend: React.js  
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js  
- NLP: Python (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, WordNet, Cosine Similarity)  
- Database: MongoDB, Excel (Quran dataset)  
- Deployment: Vercel (Frontend)

 How to Use
1. Sign Up or Login:  
   Create an account or use guest access to start exploring.  

2. Perform Searches:  
   - Enter a single word (e.g., "charity") for unigram search.  
   - Enter a pair of words (e.g., "right path") for bigram search.  
   - Enter a contextual query (e.g., "Allahâ€™s forgiveness") for semantic search.  

3. View Results:  
   - Highlighted search terms and contextually relevant verses are displayed.  

4. Audio Playback:  
   - Click the play button to hear translations with word-by-word highlighting.  

 Deployment
